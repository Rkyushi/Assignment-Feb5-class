The state of an object is represented by its attributes, and the behavior is defined by its methods. Objects can interact with each other and access the attributes and methods of other objects.\n",

    "• Abstraction: This allows the object to hide the implementation details and only show the necessary information to the user.\n",
    "• Encapsulation: This feature helps in keeping the data and functions associated with the object secure and prevent unauthorized access.\n",
    "• Inheritance: This helps in creating a new class based on an existing class by inheriting its properties and methods.\n",
    "• Polymorphism: This allows the objects of different classes to be used interchangeably in the same way, providing a level of flexibility in code design and reuse.\n"

    "#The __init__() function is used in Python as the constructor method of a class. It is automatically called when an object of a class is created.\n",
    "#The __init__() method takes in the initial values of the attributes as arguments and assigns them to the attributes of the object. It is used to initialize the attributes of an object and set the default values for them.\n",
    "#For example, consider the following class representing a rectangle:\n",
    "#Here, the __init__() method takes two arguments length and width which are the attributes of a rectangle object. When an object of the Rectangle class is created, the values of length and width are passed as arguments to the __init__() method and these values are assigned to the attributes self.length and self.width respectively.\n",
